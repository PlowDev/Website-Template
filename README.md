## Introduction
This repository is my personnal website created by Plow to make [My Website](https://plow.is-a.dev)

## Features
You can modify the links where it redirects you to, you can change the background video and the socials logo too!

## How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
```git clone https://github.com/PlowDev/Website-Template.git```
1. Open the **index.html** file in your preferred code editor.
2. Customize the content in the HTML file to reflect your personal information, projects, and skills.
3. Modify the images and background video to personalize the visual elements.
4. Save your changes and deploy the website on your hosting platform of choice. I suggest cloudfare pages.

## Customisation
**Changing Images**
Replace the existing images in Assets/img with your own. Ensure that the file names in the HTML file match your new image names.
**Background Video**
Swap out the background video by replacing the existing video file in Assets/vid. Update the file name in the HTML file accordingly.
**Colors**
Feel free to modify the color scheme by adjusting the CSS styles in the styles.css file.
